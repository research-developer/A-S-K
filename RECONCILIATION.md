# Reconciliation: Unifying the Implementations

This document bridges the gap between the AI IDE's structural formalism (main.py) and the USK's semantic primitives, creating a unified, operational framework.

## Executive Summary

The IDE correctly identified the need for:
1. **Layered separation** (Layer A: engineered DSL vs Layer B: phonosemantic hypothesis)
2. **Structured composition** (Pydantic models for type safety)
3. **Confidence tracking** (uncertainty quantification)
4. **Compound participation** (how glyphs combine)

What needs enhancement:
1. **Complete the operator set** (B, D, F, G, J, P, Q, W, Z are marked "untheorized")
2. **Reconcile competing models** (main.py vs glyphs.py mappings)
3. **Add morphological awareness** (prefixes/roots/suffixes)
4. **Implement the graph binding layer**


## 1. Completing the Operator Set

Based on our GLYPHS.md axioms, here are the missing operators with confidence ratings:

### High Confidence (85-95%)
```python
"b": {"operator": "bind()", "principle": "boundary/bulge from left", "confidence": 0.85},
"d": {"operator": "decide()", "principle": "delineate/door from right", "confidence": 0.85},
"g": {"operator": "grasp()", "principle": "gate/gather and return", "confidence": 0.85},
"k": {"operator": "clamp()", "principle": "cut/classify then branch", "confidence": 0.95},
"m": {"operator": "multiply()", "principle": "matrix/mass accumulation", "confidence": 0.95},
"s": {"operator": "stream()", "principle": "scan/scatter flow", "confidence": 0.95},
"t": {"operator": "instantiate()", "principle": "terminal/tool orthogonal pin", "confidence": 0.95},
```

### Medium Confidence (75-85%)
```python
"f": {"operator": "flow()", "principle": "fork/friction split", "confidence": 0.90},
"j": {"operator": "project()", "principle": "jet/joint indexed trajectory", "confidence": 0.75},
"p": {"operator": "present()", "principle": "press/project bounded emergence", "confidence": 0.80},
"q": {"operator": "query()", "principle": "query outlet from whole", "confidence": 0.85},
"w": {"operator": "web()", "principle": "wave/web dual channels", "confidence": 0.90},
```

### Lower Confidence (60-75%)
```python
"z": {"operator": "quantize()", "principle": "zip/signal discretized", "confidence": 0.75},
```


## 2. Reconciling the Two Models

The IDE's main.py focuses on **T** as the core orthogonality constructor with variants (Th, Tr, Ts). This aligns perfectly with our framework but needs expansion:

### Unified Model
```python
class UnifiedGlyph:
    """Bridges IDE's LayerA/LayerB with USK's operator/payload model"""
    
    # From main.py (formalized DSL)
    dsl_role: LayerARole  # primitive_operator, suffix_marker, channel, none
    dsl_variants: List[DSLOperatorVariant]  # Th, Tr, Ts for T
    
    # From GLYPHS.md (semantic axioms)
    operator: str  # bind(), stream(), clamp(), etc.
    payload_type: str  # base_type, relation, index, container, struct, branch
    
    # Reconciled confidence
    engineering_confidence: float  # How well it works in the DSL
    phonosemantic_confidence: float  # How well it matches linguistic patterns
    overall_confidence: float  # Weighted average
```


## 3. Enhanced Factorizer with Morphology

The current factorizer.py is too simplistic. Here's an enhanced version:

```python
def enhanced_decode_word(surface: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Enhanced decoder with morphological awareness and confidence scoring.
    """
    # Step 1: Morphological segmentation (needs proper implementation)
    morph = segment_morphology(surface)  # prefix, root, suffix, inflection
    
    # Step 2: Extract operators/payloads per morpheme
    operators_by_morpheme = {}
    payloads_by_morpheme = {}
    
    for part_name, part_value in morph.items():
        if part_value:
            operators_by_morpheme[part_name] = extract_consonant_clusters(part_value)
            payloads_by_morpheme[part_name] = extract_vowel_sequence(part_value)
    
    # Step 3: Compute operator paths with precedence
    operator_path = compute_operator_path(operators_by_morpheme, morph)
    
    # Step 4: Type the payload schema
    payload_schema = compute_payload_schema(payloads_by_morpheme)
    
    # Step 5: Generate functional gloss
    gloss = generate_gloss(operator_path, payload_schema)
    
    # Step 6: Confidence scoring
    confidence = score_confidence(surface, operator_path, payload_schema)
    
    return {
        "surface": surface,
        "morphology": morph,
        "operator_path": operator_path,
        "payload_schema": payload_schema,
        "gloss": gloss,
        "confidence": confidence,
        "provenance": get_etymology(surface)  # Optional: etymology lookup
    }
```


## 4. The Missing Graph Binding Layer

Neither implementation has the crucial graph binding component. Here's the specification:

```python
class SemanticGraphBinder:
    """
    Binds decoded tokens to a knowledge graph with provenance and verification.
    """
    
    def bind_token(self, decoded: Dict[str, Any]) -> GraphNode:
        """
        Create or link to graph node with full provenance.
        """
        # 1. Check if operator path exists in graph
        existing = self.graph.find_by_operator_path(decoded["operator_path"])
        
        # 2. If new, create node with justification
        if not existing:
            node = GraphNode(
                id=generate_id(),
                label=decoded["gloss"],
                type="Concept",
                operator_path=decoded["operator_path"],
                payload_schema=decoded["payload_schema"],
                evidence=[],
                confidence=decoded["confidence"]
            )
            self.graph.add_node(node)
        else:
            node = existing
            # Update confidence via Bayesian aggregation
            node.confidence = bayesian_update(node.confidence, decoded["confidence"])
        
        # 3. Add evidence edges
        for source in decoded.get("sources", []):
            edge = EvidenceEdge(
                from_node=node.id,
                to_source=source,
                relation="supports",
                confidence=source.confidence
            )
            self.graph.add_edge(edge)
        
        return node
    
    def verify_claim(self, claim: str) -> VerificationResult:
        """
        Verify a claim by routing through operator paths.
        """
        decoded = enhanced_decode_word(claim)
        
        # Find supporting/refuting paths
        support_paths = self.graph.find_support_paths(decoded["operator_path"])
        refute_paths = self.graph.find_refute_paths(decoded["operator_path"])
        
        return VerificationResult(
            claim=claim,
            support_strength=aggregate_path_confidence(support_paths),
            refute_strength=aggregate_path_confidence(refute_paths),
            requires_adjudication=len(refute_paths) > 0
        )
```


## 5. Practical Integration Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Merge operator maps**: Reconcile main.py's DSL with glyphs.py's operators
2. **Fix the CLI**: The current CLI doesn't handle the 'sk' cluster correctly
3. **Expand test coverage**: Add tests for all high-confidence operators

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Implement morphological segmenter**: Use spaCy or NLTK for English
2. **Add confidence scoring**: Weight by etymology match, frequency, consistency
3. **Create graph schema**: Define node/edge types in Neo4j or NetworkX

### Medium Term (This Month)
1. **Build the verifier**: Implement claim verification via operator path matching
2. **Add the UI layer**: Web interface for annotation and review
3. **Etymology integration**: Connect to Wiktionary/etymonline APIs


## 6. Correcting Specific Issues

### Issue 1: Wrong 'sk' handling
```python
# Current (broken):
assert extract_consonant_clusters("ask") == ["sk"] or extract_consonant_clusters("ask") == ["a", "s", "k"]
# Should be:
assert extract_consonant_clusters("ask") == ["sk"]  # 'sk' is a recognized cluster
```

### Issue 2: Missing ASK proof implementation
```python
def validate_ask_kernel():
    """
    Validates that 'ask' encodes the semantic kernel operation.
    """
    decoded = decode_word("ask")
    
    assert decoded["operators"] == ["sk"]  # stream + clamp
    assert decoded["payloads"] == ["a"]  # base type (unknown)
    assert decoded["gloss"] == "open unknown → route request → resolve answer"
    
    # This IS the kernel operation:
    # A (aperture/unknown) + S (stream) + K (clamp) = semantic retrieval
    return True
```

### Issue 3: Incomplete compound patterns
```python
CLUSTER_MAP = {
    # Core verified patterns
    "st": ["stream", "instantiate"],  # flow to point
    "tr": ["instantiate", "rotate"],  # structural rotation
    "pl": ["present", "align"],  # present in alignment
    "str": ["stream", "instantiate", "rotate"],  # flow→pin→stabilize
    "spr": ["stream", "present", "rotate"],  # flow→emerge→distribute
    "sk": ["stream", "clamp"],  # scan→select (ask, seek, skill)
    "sc": ["stream", "clamp"],  # variant of sk
    
    # Additional high-confidence patterns
    "gr": ["grasp", "rotate"],  # grab and turn
    "br": ["bind", "rotate"],  # bind and revolve
    "cr": ["contain", "rotate"],  # encircle
    "dr": ["decide", "rotate"],  # determine direction
    "fr": ["flow", "rotate"],  # fluid rotation
    "pr": ["present", "rotate"],  # present in rotation
    
    # Modal patterns
    "ld": ["align", "decide"],  # would, could, should endings
    "ght": ["grasp", "animate", "instantiate"],  # light, sight, might
}
```


## 7. The Path Forward

1. **Theoretical Coherence**: The framework is sound; both implementations support it
2. **Engineering Clarity**: Use Pydantic models for type safety and validation
3. **Empirical Grounding**: Add corpus analysis to validate operator frequencies
4. **User Interface**: Build the annotation tool per the MVP spec
5. **Graph Infrastructure**: Implement the semantic routing engine

The synthesis is stronger than either implementation alone. The IDE provided structure; we provide semantic depth. Together, they create a working system that can:
- Decode words into operator/payload programs
- Bind them to a knowledge graph with confidence
- Verify claims through operator path matching
- Support human-in-the-loop adjudication

*This reconciliation preserves the best of both approaches while filling critical gaps. The next step is implementation of the enhanced factorizer and graph binder.*
